# simple-dbg
A simple debugger written in rust. (WIP)

## How to build
Run the build script: `./build.sh`

Then execute the binary: `./simple-dbg [FLAGS] [FILE]`

Flags: None for now.

## Roadmap

[X] Handle flags & arguments

[X] Basic binary file parsing

[_] More advanced file parsing (parsing assembly correctly)

[_] Figure our how debuggers work

[_] Successfully interrupt the program at where it is specified

[_] Make memory inspection tools
